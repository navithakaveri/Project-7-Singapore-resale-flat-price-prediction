# Project-7-Singapore-resale-flat-price-prediction

**DATA COLLECTION:**
The project begins with a data Collection such as flat type,flat model,floor sqrt,resale price etc...


**DATA PREPROCESSING**
After collecting data,next steps is data preprocessing, which involves handling missing values, removing duplicate values, and converting data types to prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.

**ANALYSIS THE DATA**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS:
Analysis done by taking one varibale such as flat type,flat model etc for categorical column.
Analysis done by taking on variable such as resale price,minimum storey,maximum storey,floor are sqrt.

BIVARIATE ANALYSIS:
Analysis done using pairplots -floor_area_sqm,resale_price,maximum_storey,minimum_storey,year.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS:
Analysis numerical variable to find a correlation between multiple variable using heatmap.

**MODEL TRAINING**

**step1:**ENCODING****
using ordinal encode for converting categorical variable into numerical variable for model training.

**step2__init__ method**
*Initializes the list of models.Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.train_and_evaluate_model function:

**Trains a given model**
Predicts the target values for both training and testing sets.
Calculates and returns the evaluation metrics.
**all_model method**
Iterates over all the models.
Uses the train_and_evaluate_model function to train and evaluate each model.
Compiles the results into a DataFrame and returns it.

**step3 Data Preparation:**
*The input features (x) and the target variable (y) are extracted from a DataFrame, likely in preparation for a machine learning task.
*Model Initialization: An instance of a regression model class (possibly custom or from a library) is created, passing the input features and target variable to it.
*Model Training and Evaluation: The all_model() method of the regression model instance is called. That method trains and evaluates various regression models using the provided data. The specifics of the models trained and evaluation metrics used are handled within the all_model() method.
Result Storage: The results or trained models generated by the all_model() method are stored in the variable r_models.

*extracts the training and testing sets (x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test) from an instance named regression_models. These sets are likely split during the instantiation of the regression class earlier in the code
**XGBRegressor**
*Extracted the training and testing sets from the instance for further analysis

*trains an XGBoost regressor model (XGBRegressor) using default hyperparameters on the training data (x_train and y_train), makes predictions on both the training and test datasets, and calculates the mean squared error (MSE) for both sets of predictions.

*hyperparameter tuning for an XGBoost regressor (XGBRegressor) using grid search with cross-validation (GridSearchCV). 

*trains an XGBoost regressor model (XGBRegressor) with specified hyperparameters (learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=5, n_estimators=200) on the training data (x_train and y_train), makes predictions on the test set (x_test), and evaluates the model's performance using various metrics.

*trains a Decision Tree regressor model (DecisionTreeRegressor) on the training data (x_train and y_train), makes predictions on both the training and test datasets, and calculates the mean squared error (MSE) for both sets of predictions

*hyperparameter tuning for a Decision Tree regressor (DecisionTreeRegressor) using grid search with cross-validation (GridSearchCV

* predicts the resale price using two different regression models: XGBoost Regressor (xgb_model) and Decision Tree Regressor (decision_tree_model).
  
* evaluating the performance of the trained regression models (decision_tree_model and xgb_model) on a test dataset extracted from the original DataFrame (df1)
  
* creates a DataFrame named pred to compare the predicted resale prices from the Decision Tree Regressor and XGBoost Regressor models with the actual resale prices from the dataset

* With help of dataframe DecisionTreeRegressor's predicted resale price is near to the Actual resale price. That's I am going to choose 'DecisionTreeRegressor' for resale price prediction
